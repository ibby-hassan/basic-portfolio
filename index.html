                <h2>Manifesto</h2>
                <p> Salaam alaikum wa rahma. <br>
                    <br>
                    SubhanAllah, another term’s come and gone. This will be my final university year, and fourth involved with GUMSA. 
                    That's four years spent learning from, laughing with, and growing alongside this community.<br>
                    Though unsure whom else is running for the role, I <em>am</em> sure of their integrity and their worth; 
                    from amongst you I consistently find reasons to smile, reminders of purpose, and humility at what we can achieve together.<br>
                    Between the strong, the brave, the intellectual, the old and the new, there is just one thing I uniquely offer: <em>experience</em>, and all that comes with it.<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Alhamdulillah, I have been given a broad network, know-how, and an intimate perspective on the university landscape from many roles within it. 
                    Year after year, I’ve watched committees build on each other. Presently, I forecast many new, impressionable faces joining us. 
                    However, it is also an unprecedented, divisive time for the ummah.<br>
                    Thus, I feel GUMSA presidency is where I’m best placed to provide a space of unity, community, and security for education and religious expression.<br>
                    <br>
                    In action, I pledge to keep the momentum going - maintain an Islamic presence, expand dialogue and education, 
                    involve general members with committee events such as Charity Week planning, refine committee workflows, etc.<br>
                    In this way I hope to acclimatise our new members to our community, as well as strengthen the platform for those to come.<br>
                    <br>
                    May Allah SWT keep our intentions pure, hearts soft, and resolve firm. “Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."<br>
                    <br>
                    Ameen.
