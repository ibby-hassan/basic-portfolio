            <p> Salaam alaikum wa rahmatullah. <br>
                <br>
                SubhanAllah, another term’s come and gone. This will be my final university year, and fourth involved with GUMSA. 
                That's four years spent learning from, laughing with, and growing alongside this community.<br>
                Maryam and Yusuf are strong candidates, each capable of bringing their own unique strengths to the role.
                I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to run alongside them.<br>
                Between them, my pledges are in some way similar. I look to expand student activism, awareness, and the muslim voice.<br>
                But, most uniquely, I aim to break the clique culture within GUMSA.<br>
                <br>
                
                Alhamdulillah, I have been given a broad network, know-how, and an intimate perspective on the university landscape from many roles within it. 
                Year after year, I’ve watched committees build on each other. Presently, I forecast many new, impressionable faces joining us.<br>
                Now more than ever, the community needs a voice and platform where the individual voice is heard, and the collective voice is unified.<br>
                <br>

                In action, I pledge to keep the momentum going - maintain our classes, maintain our outreach. But to also create regular feedback forms, enlist general members on projects such as Charity Week, or newsletters, and generally serve, rather than govern.<br>
                In this way I hope to acclimatise our new members to our community, as well as strengthen the platform for those to come.<br>
                <br>
                
                May Allah SWT keep our intentions pure, hearts soft, and resolve firm. “Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."<br>
                <br>
                Ameen. 
                </p>
