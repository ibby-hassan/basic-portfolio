            <p> Salaam alaikum wa rahmatullah. <br>
                <br>
                SubhanAllah, another term’s come and gone. This will be my final university year, and fourth involved with GUMSA. 
                That's four years spent learning from, laughing with, and growing alongside this community.<br>
                Maryam and Yusuf are strong candidates, each capable of bringing their own unique strengths to the role.
                I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to run alongside them.<br>
                Indeed, from amongst any of you, I consistently find reasons to smile, reminders of purpose, and humility at what we can achieve together.<br>
                Through all that, there is just one thing I uniquely offer: my experiences, and all that comes with it.<br>
                <br>
                
                Alhamdulillah, I have been given a broad network, know-how, and an intimate perspective on the university landscape from many roles within it. 
                Year after year, I’ve watched committees build on each other. Presently, I forecast many new, impressionable faces joining us. 
                However, it is also an unprecedented, and unfortunately divisive time for the ummah.<br>
                Thus, I feel GUMSA presidency is where I’m best placed to provide a space of unity, community, and security for education and religious expression.<br>
                <br>
                In action, I pledge to keep the momentum going - maintain an Islamic outreach, expand essential dialogues and education both Islamic and societal, 
                involve general members with committee such as through Charity Week planning, refine committee workflows, etc.<br>
                In this way I hope to acclimatise our new members to our community, as well as strengthen the platform for those to come.<br>
                This also aims to combat clique culture.<br>
                <br>
                May Allah SWT keep our intentions pure, hearts soft, and resolve firm. “Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."<br>
                <br>
                Ameen.
