        "answer":"There are two matters relevant in our community presently, which I hope to focus attention towards.<br><br>The first is global affairs/social justice. GUMSA has many, many intellectual figures within its network. I hope to utilise our resources to prioritise education: facilitating dialogue on current events from the arms trade to climate change to global humanitarian crises.<br>One implementation of this would be a Topic of the Week - focussing fundraising, social media, and halaqah themes on these events.<br><br>The second matter is the onset of new faces within the community, and providing opportunities to get involved so they can take on the mantle.<br>To this end, I would like to open event planning and committee discourse to interested volunteers and members."

        "question": "'What measures will you take to combat free-mixing and other common fitnahs?'",
        "answer": "Salaam Adam. Very, good question.<br><br>Make no mistake, free mixing has been a priority issue for as long as I've known ISOCs - an eternal stereotype, and a fitnah every student will be forced to confront in our environment.<br>And the wrong way to deal with it is ostracisation; GUMSA as a platform must not appear as a clique; judgemental.<br><br>So segregation of mixed events, and general Islamic professionalism during socials is a given. Outside of these circumstances, however, committee members will still be expected to lead by example - maintaining a certain standard in casual settings in/around campus.<br>In order to ensure guidance is accepted, and not delivered from any kind of 'high horse', exec will attend a mandatory workshop lead by our local ulema on Islamic conduct and navigating gendered interaction in university.<br>The intention here is to emphasise preaching through actions; setting a standard that continues to compound over the years, and setting up the committee of 26-27 to carry the torch."

      "question": "How will you support Palestine? How do you feel about protests, and the way they are being lead?",
      "answer": "Palestine is THE cause for the Muslims to rally behind, and now more than ever it is essential the ummah on campus unifies.<br>Honest, earnest communication is critical between student bodies during this time, and I hope to facilitate this personally.<br><br>Speaking frankly, social justice and activism is a responsibility upon every muslim.<br> As president, I will therefore utilise GUMSA's platform to educate on how to uphold this duty fi-sabilillah.<br>This entails collaborating with community members to create an informative regular newsletter, published with information on campus news and current affairs. We will also host dialogue workshops with trusted ulema to discuss and promote Islamic forms of activism.<br><br>With regards to protests, insha'Allah I hope the emphasis on education will lead to the organisation and attendance of all Islamically endorsed strikes, protests and demonstrations in our greater community; simultaneously arming the community with knowledge on that which benefits their deen, and what harms it."

	    "answer": "God willing.<br>I suppose it depends on what you measure 'good' as. My personal success metrics are based on community feedback. My main concern as President is to maintain an open, safe, developmental campus environment for everyone we represent. This will involve a constant push for community feedback; publishing a 'You said, We did' issue board on our website is one way we can accomplish this.<br><br>By amplifying the people's voices, I trust in promoting an honest atmosphere wherein I can best serve, recieve feedback, and constantly improve. Take faith in this pledge, and I hope to be held accountable for it in turn."

	    "answer": "Thanks for the question!<br><br>I'm very set on maximising summer. If made president, summer will be used to build committee cohesion, familiarity, and teamwork. I'll be focussing on team-building activities such as workshops on Islamic professionalism, on student activism, and on setting up infrastructure for the upcoming year.<br><br>A LOT of work goes into GUMSA during this time.. Office bearers need relevant training, treasury has to the Discount Card scheme to consider, and GenSecs have a lot of workflows to run, to name a few. Alhamdulillah, I've gone through the motions a few times now, so I'll be looking to ease the new committee through this period, and get us in good standing for when term starts."
