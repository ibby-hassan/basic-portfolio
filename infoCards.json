      "question":"What will you do as President?",
      "answer":"There are two matters relevant in our community presently, which I hope to focus attention towards.<br><br>The first is global affairs/social justice. GUMSA has many, many intellectual figures within its network. I hope to utilise our resources to prioritise education: facilitating dialogue on current events from the arms trade to climate change to global humanitarian crises.<br>One implementation of this would be a Topic of the Week - focussing fundraising, social media, and halaqah themes on these events.<br><br>The second matter is the onset of new faces within the community, and providing opportunities to get involved so they can take on the mantle.<br>To this end, I would like to open event planning and committee discourse to interested volunteers and members."
