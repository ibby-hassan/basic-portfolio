        "question":"'What will you do as President?'",
        "answer":"There are two matters relevant in our community presently, which I hope to focus attention towards.<br><br>The first is global affairs/social justice. GUMSA has many, many intellectual figures within its network. I hope to utilise our resources to prioritise education: facilitating dialogue on current events from the arms trade to climate change to global humanitarian crises.<br>One implementation of this would be a Topic of the Week - focussing fundraising, social media, and halaqah themes on these events.<br><br>The second matter is the onset of new faces within the community, and providing opportunities to get involved so they can take on the mantle.<br>To this end, I would like to open event planning and committee discourse to interested volunteers and members."

        "question": "'What measures will you take to combat free-mixing and other common fitnahs?'",
        "answer": "Salaam Adam. Very, very good question.<br><br>Make no mistake, free mixing has been a priority issue for as long as I've known ISOCS. It's an eternal stereotype, and a fitnah every student is forced to confront in our environment.<br>And the wrong way to deal with it is ostracisation; GUMSA as a platform must not appear as a clique; judgemental.<br><br>Segregation of events and conduct in professional settings is granted. However, committee will also be expected to lead by example outside of this, too - maintaining a standard in casual settings in/around campus.<br>Guidance and education will come from a place of understanding, humility, and forgiveness. Exec will attend a mandatory workshop lead by our local ulema on Islamic conduct and navigating gendered interaction in university.<br>The intention here is to emphasise preaching through actions; setting a standard that continues to compound over the years, and setting up the committee of 26-27 to carry the torch."
